## Create a new zone
#
#  The following commands are used to create a new zone in PowerDNS.

# Specify a TLD name on which to operate. In this example, the TLD is "tldtest1", 
# which specifies a zone for SLDs like "mydomain.tldtest1".
ZONE=tldtest1

./pdnsutil add-record $ZONE SOA "a.gtld-servers.net. nstld.verisign-grs.com. 1 900 1800 6048000 3600"

## DNSSEC Configuration

#  The following commands are used to setup DNSSEC for a given zone. Assumes the

## DNSSEC ZSK key rotation (monthly)
#
#  The following commands are used to rotate the ZSK for a given zone.
#  https://doc.powerdns.com/authoritative/guides/zskroll.html

# Create an INACTIVE/PUBLISHED key that can begin propagating
./pdnsutil add-zone-key $ZONE zsk 1024 inactive published rsasha256

# Show the settings and make note of the key IDs for both the old and
# new ZSKs to be used later.
./pdnsutil show-zone $ZONE

# Validate with dig that the DNSKEY is available, making note of the TTL
# for this record. Need to wait for both old/new DNSKEY records to be shown
# on secondary DNS servers before proceeding.
dig DNSKEY $ZONE @127.0.0.1

# Change activation status for the two ZSKs. The key IDs are found in the
# previous output from show-zone. At this point, the new ZSK will be used
# for signing, but the old key is still available for verification.
./pdnsutil activate-zone-key $ZONE NEW-ZSK-ID
./pdnsutil deactivate-zone-key $ZONE OLD-ZSK-ID

# Wait for the longest TTL to ensure all secondaries have latest values,
# and then remove the old key.
./pdnsutil remove-zone-key $ZONE OLD-ZSK-ID

## DNSSEC KSK key rotation (annually)
#
#  The following commands are used to rotate the KSK for a given zone.
#  https://doc.powerdns.com/authoritative/guides/kskroll.html

# Create an ACTIVE/PUBLISHED key that can begin propagating
./pdnsutil add-zone-key $ZONE ksk 2048 active published rsasha256

# Show the settings and make note of the key IDs for both the old and
# new KSKs to be used later.
./pdnsutil show-zone $ZONE

# Validate with dig that the DNSKEY is available, making note of the TTL
# for this record. Need to wait for both old/new DNSKEY records to be shown
# on secondary DNS servers before proceeding.
dig DNSKEY $ZONE @127.0.0.1

# Now that both old/new KSK values are being used to sign (both are active),
# we can communicate with the gTLD registry to give them a new DS value to
# publish in the parent DNS zone. The output of DS or DNSKEY for the new KSK
# can be provided to the registry, depending on what format they need. Some
# registries may handle this automatically by reading our DNSKEY records, but
# need to verify on a per-registry basis if this is the case.
./pdnsutil show-zone $ZONE

# After propagation, the old key may be removed.
./pdnsutil remove-zone-key $ZONE OLD-KSK-ID
