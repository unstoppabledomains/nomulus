# This Dockerfile builds an image that can be used in Google Cloud Build.
# We need the following programs to build the schema deployer:
# 1. Bash to execute a shell script.
# 2. Java 11 for running the Flywaydb commandline tool.
# 2. Cloud SQL proxy for connection to the SQL instance.
# 3. The Flywaydb commandline tool.
#
# Please refer to deploy_sql_schema.sh for expected volumes and arguments.

# Although any Linux-based Java image with bash would work (e.g., openjdk:11),
# as a GCP application we prefer to start with a GCP-approved base image.
